# Machine-learning
Welcome to the **Machine Learning Project** repository! This project contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, along with detailed explanations and code examples. The project is designed to help you understand core concepts in machine learning and how to apply them to real-world datasets.


This repository contains machine learning models built using **Python**. The models are implemented using libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

### Key Algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)



Dataset Preprocessing Includes:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical data
Feature scaling
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
