# Machine-learning
Welcome to the **Machine Learning Project** repository! This project contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, along with detailed explanations and code examples. The project is designed to help you understand core concepts in machine learning and how to apply them to real-world datasets.
, we will explore various concepts and techniques in machine learning, including:

- Data preparation using **pandas**
- Data visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Supervised learning techniques
- Unsupervised learning techniques
- Model evaluation and saving/loading models

  To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- **Python**: A programming language commonly used for machine learning and data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running Python code, making it easier to document your thought process and visualize results.
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **numpy**: For numerical computations and working with arrays.
  - **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  - **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, built on top of matplotlib.

This repository is organized into the following folders:


notebooks/: Includes Jupyter notebooks for different sections:

supervised/: Supervised Learning notebooks.
unsupervised/: Unsupervised Learning notebooks.
fundamentals/: Core concepts and libraries like matplotlib, numpy, pandas, statistics, onehot, save_model, and train_test_split.
