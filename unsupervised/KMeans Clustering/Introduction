KMeans Clustering
This folder contains an implementation of KMeans Clustering, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning datasets into distinct 
clusters based on feature similarity. KMeans iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids based on the 
current cluster memberships.

Key Features:
Elbow Method:

Used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) against the number of clusters.
The "elbow" point in the graph suggests the ideal number of clusters, balancing model accuracy and complexity.
Silhouette Score:

A metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering.
It measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, with a score ranging from -1 (incorrect clustering) to 
+1 (highly dense and well-separated clusters).
This score helps validate the results from the elbow method and ensure optimal clustering.
