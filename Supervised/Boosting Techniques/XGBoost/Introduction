 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Concept: XGBoost is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting that includes several optimizations such as tree pruning, 
regularization (L1 and L2), and efficient handling of missing values. Itâ€™s known for being fast and highly accurate.
Key Features:
Regularization to prevent overfitting.
Built-in handling of missing data.
Parallel processing for faster computation.
Pros: Scalable, high performance, good for large datasets.
Cons: Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.
