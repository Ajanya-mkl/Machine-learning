Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary and multi-class classification problems. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous outcomes, logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome, typically modeled using a logistic function.

1. Binary Logistic Regression
In binary logistic regression, the target variable has two possible outcomes, such as "yes" or "no", "success" or "failure". The model estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.

Example: Predicting whether a customer will buy insurance based on their demographics and other factors.

2. Multiclass Logistic Regression
Multiclass logistic regression is an extension of logistic regression where the target variable has more than two possible categories. Various techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR) or Softmax can be used to handle multiple classes.

Example: Classifying types of iris flowers based on petal and sepal features.

Datasets 
1. Insurance Dataset
Objective: Predict whether a customer will purchase insurance based on various features.
Key Steps:
Evaluating Metrics: Assess the model using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Accuracy Score: Measure the overall accuracy of the logistic regression model.
Confusion Matrix: Generate and interpret the confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the binary classification model.
2. Multiclass Classification
Objective: Perform multiclass classification and evaluate the model's performance using a classification report.
Key Step:
Classification Report: Generate a detailed classification report that includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
