Decision trees are versatile machine learning algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. A decision tree model splits the dataset into smaller subsets while incrementally building an associated decision tree. Each node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf represents an outcome. Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them popular for various machine learning problems.

1. Decision Tree Classifier
A decision tree classifier is used for categorical output. It predicts the class label based on a set of input features by following a sequence of decisions.

Example: Predicting employee salaries based on features like experience, education, and job role.

2. Decision Tree Regressor
A decision tree regressor is used for continuous outputs. It estimates a target value by splitting the data and making decisions based on numerical variables.

Example: Predicting a candidate's salary using the hiring.csv dataset by considering features like years of experience and test scores.

Datasets 
1. Salaries Dataset (Decision Tree Classifier)
Objective: Use a decision tree classifier to predict whether an employee’s salary falls within a certain range based on various job-related factors.
Key Steps:
Train and evaluate the decision tree classifier.
Visualize the decision tree and interpret the rules.
2. Hiring Dataset (Decision Tree Regressor)
Objective: Use a decision tree regressor to predict a candidate’s salary based on experience, test scores, and other features in the hiring dataset.
Key Steps:
Train the decision tree regressor.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
3. Iris Dataset (Post-Pruning)
Objective: Apply post-pruning techniques to avoid overfitting the decision tree model on the iris.csv dataset.
Key Steps:
Train the decision tree model.
Implement post-pruning methods to reduce the model’s complexity.
Compare performance before and after pruning.
4. Iris Dataset (Pre-Pruning with Hyperparameter Tuning)
Objective: Perform pre-pruning on the decision tree by tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance on the iris.csv dataset.
Key Steps:
Use GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning.
Implement pre-pruning strategies such as limiting the maximum depth and the minimum number of samples per leaf.
Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
