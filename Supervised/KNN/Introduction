K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful, instance-based learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The KNN algorithm works by finding the "k" nearest data points to a given instance and making predictions based on their values. It does not rely on a specific model but rather stores all available cases and classifies or predicts new data points based on similarity.

1. KNN Classifier
The KNN classifier is used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a categorical label. It assigns a class to a new data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

Example: Classifying iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

2. KNN Regressor
The KNN regressor is used for regression tasks, predicting continuous output by averaging the values of the nearest neighbors.

Example: Predicting the price of a diamond based on features such as carat, cut, and clarity.
